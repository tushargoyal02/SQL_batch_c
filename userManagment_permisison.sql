/*
databases have evolved to support multiple users
 and roles and provide a means to control privileges and 
 access on a very fine-grained 
level to guarantee secure shared environments.


 Users in MySQL are special objects used for the purpose of:

Authentication (making sure that a user can access the MySQL server)
Authorization (making sure that a user can interact
 with objects in the database)

Some DBMSs support the concept of object ownership. 
That is, when the user creates a database object—a database or schema,
 a table, or a stored procedure—that user automatically 
 becomes the new object’s owner. 
 The owner usually has the ability to modify objects it owns 
 and grant other users access to them. The important thing here 
 is that MySQL does not in any way have a concept of object ownership.

 Privileges can be thought of as sets of rules controlling what 
 actions users are
 allowed to perform and what data they can access. 
 
 Users in MySQL are also a bit different than in other databases,
 because the user object includes a network access control list (ACL). 
 Usually, 
 a MySQL user is represented not just by its name, like bob,
 but with an appended network address, like bob@localhost.

'bob'@'10.0.2.%', where bob is the username and
 10.0.2.% is a hostname specification. In fact, it’s a hostname specification with a wildcard. Each time someone connects with the username bob using TCP, MySQL will do a few things:

- Get the IP address of the connecting client.
- Perform a reverse DNS lookup of the IP address to a hostname.
- Perform a DNS lookup for that hostname 
(to make sure the reverse lookup wasn’t compromised).
- Check the hostname or IP address with the user’s hostname specification.

 Global privileges
either act on every object in every database or act
 on the cluster as a whole
 Privileges in this category are stored
 within the tables mysql.user and mysql.global_grants. 
 The first one stores conventional static privileges, 
 and the second one stores dynamic privileges
 
 
 Database privileges
Privileges granted on a database level
 will allow the user to act upon objects within that database.
 
 Records for these privileges are stored within the 
 mysql.db table and include the ability to run DDL 
 and DML queries within the target database.
 
 
 Object privileges
A logical continuation of database-level privileges, 
these target a particular object. Tracked in mysql.tables_priv, 
mysql.procs_priv, and mysql.proxies_priv, they respectively cover
 tables and views, all types of stored routines, and finally the proxy 
 user permissions.
 
 
 Column privileges
Stored in mysql.columns_priv, these are an interesting set of privileges. 
You can separate permissions within a particular table by column.

 The GRANT statement is used to grant users (or roles) permissions

 The same statement can also be used to assign roles to users,

 To be able to grant a permission (privilege), you need to have that 
 privilege assigned yourself and have the special GRANT OPTION privilege
